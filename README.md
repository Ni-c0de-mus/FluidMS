# FluidMS

FluidMS offers a font-size system that enables you to use [Modular Scale](https://www.modularscale.com/) in combination with the [Fluid Typography](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography/) technique. It also ensures that all your typography always sits on a vertical grid which size you can define.

## Browser Support

As FluidMS uses [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*), the [browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables) is limited accordingly.
